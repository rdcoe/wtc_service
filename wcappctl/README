This project builds an rpm that installs scripts to control Windchill.  Building
the project needs to be done on the target platform, to ensure rpm compatibility 
(there are no compiled binaries to worry about).

Build the rpm:
# make

The default make target will set up the build environment in the /home/build and
build the rpm there.  If the rpm builds successfully, it will be copied back to 
./dist.

You should create a chrooted enviroment for testing the rpm but there's not much 
damage to be done by installing it, since there are no runnables.  To install, 
e.g., rpm -Uhv wcappctl-1-1.noarch.rpm
